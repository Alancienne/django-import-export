=============================
Asynchronous export back ends
=============================

There are no back ends included with django-import-export at this time. You may
be able to find some that can be installed separately, or you can write your own. 
To do this, create a class with a ``create_task`` method that passes takes the
task parameters and uses them to pass export the data.

It should look something like this:

    class AsyncBackend(object):

        def create_task(self, format_name, query, resource_class_input_name, resource_kwargs, user_id, email_subject_line):
            # Code to create the task here.
 

It will also need to send an email to the user who requested the export to let 
them know when it is finished.
